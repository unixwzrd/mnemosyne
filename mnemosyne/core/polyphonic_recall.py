Mnemosyne Polyphonic Recall Engine
===================================
Multi-strategy parallel retrieval with deterministic re-ranking.

Strategies (4 voices):
1. Vector voice: Dense semantic similarity over working_memory + episodic_memory
2. Graph voice: Episodic graph traversal (Phase 3)
3. Fact voice: Structured fact matching (Phase 4)
4. Temporal voice: Time-aware scoring

Deterministic re-ranker:
- Combines 4 scores with learned weights
- No neural network (rule-based weighting)
- Budget-aware context assembly
- Diversity penalty (avoid duplicates)

Building on:
- Hindsight's multi-strategy retrieval (blog)
- Memanto's information-theoretic scoring (arXiv:2604.22085)
- Our novel deterministic combination

        Voice 1: Dense semantic similarity over WM + EM.

        Queries the production-canonical dense embedding store
        (`memory_embeddings`) — the same source the linear recall path
        uses via `_wm_vec_search` / `_in_memory_vec_search` (the
        numpy-cosine fallback layer in beam.py). Pre-fix this voice
        queried the standalone `binary_vectors` table which production
        never wrote to (NAI-4 wrote binary vectors as a column on
        episodic_memory, NOT to that table); the result was a silently
        empty vector voice and a 3-voice polyphonic engine.

        Returning to a single source of truth across the recall stack
        matches the cross-system convergence pattern (Hindsight, mem0,
        Zep, Cognee, Letta all use one dense store shared by every
        retrieval path) and makes polyphonic-vs-linear comparisons
        apples-to-apples for the BEAM-recovery experiment.

        EM tier prefers sqlite-vec's `vec_episodes` virtual table when
        available (same fast-path the linear scorer uses via
        `beam._vec_search`); falls through to numpy cosine over
        `memory_embeddings` on any failure. WM tier uses numpy cosine
        (matches the linear path — no sqlite-vec WM index exists
        today).

        Reads both WM and EM tiers, filters out invalidated /
        superseded / expired rows (mirror of `_wm_vec_search` WHERE
        clauses for both tiers), and ranks by cosine similarity.
        Dedups across WM/EM by `memory_id` keeping the
        higher-similarity occurrence — without this, a memory that
        exists in both tiers post-E3 would be double-counted in RRF
        and silently cap unique candidates below `top_k=20`.
