"""
Mnemosyne Veracity-Weighted Consolidation
=========================================
Our novel contribution: Bayesian confidence scoring + conflict resolution.

Veracity tiers:
- stated:     1.0  (user explicitly stated)
- inferred:   0.7  (inferred from context)
- tool:       0.5  (tool output, may be stale)
- imported:   0.6  (imported from external source)
- unknown:    0.8  (default, unverified)

Bayesian updating:
- confidence = 1 - (0.7^n) where n = mention count
- More mentions = higher confidence
- Contradictions detected and flagged

Conflict resolution:
- Same subject + predicate = potential conflict
- Higher confidence wins
- Lower confidence flagged for review
- Consolidation: periodic synthesis of high-confidence facts

def compute_fact_id(subject: str, predicate: str, object: str) -> str:
    """Deterministic ID for a (subject, predicate, object) tuple.

    Pre-fix `consolidated_facts.id` used
    ``f"cf_{subject}_{predicate}_{object}".replace(" ", "_")[:100]``.
    The 100-char truncation silently collided on long content: two
    distinct facts with the same first ~95 chars after replace
    produced identical PKs. The IntegrityError that resulted from
    the INSERT was swallowed by the calling code at
    `beam.py:_ingest_graph_and_veracity` (broad `except: pass` in
    Phase 4), producing silent data loss.

    Post-fix: SHA-256 hash of NFC-normalized SPO with length-prefix
    framing. Always-uniform 27 chars (`cf_` + 24 hex). Properties:

      - **Collision-safe across content lengths.** Hash never
        truncates the input — long SPOs are encoded fully.
      - **Smuggle-safe.** Length-prefix framing (``b"3:foo4:isax"``)
        makes the encoding injective: two distinct SPO tuples can
        never produce the same byte string regardless of whether a
        component contains a separator-like character.
        ``compute_fact_id("a\\x1f", "b", "c")`` no longer collides
        with ``compute_fact_id("a", "\\x1fb", "c")``.
      - **Unicode-stable.** NFC normalization applied per field so
        ``"café"`` (NFC) and ``"café"`` (NFD) hash identically.
      - **Codebase-consistent.** SHA-256 matches the digest choice
        used elsewhere (`beam.py:770`, `importers/base.py:181`,
        `importers/hindsight.py:144`).

    Two facts with the same SPO produce the same ID (idempotency
    preserved — `consolidate_fact`'s dedup still relies on SPO
    equality, not ID equality). Distinct facts produce distinct
    IDs regardless of content length.

    Backward compat: existing rows keep their stored pre-fix IDs.
    `consolidate_fact` continues to dedup by SPO match (the
    SELECT WHERE subject=? AND predicate=? AND object=? at line
    matching pre-fix), so old rows are found correctly on UPDATE.
    Only newly inserted rows get the new format. Cross-format DBs
    work indefinitely. `_fact_voice` reads the stored row id
    (via ConsolidatedFact.id) rather than recomputing — preserves
    RRF-key alignment for legacy rows.

        Wraps the block in ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` when the connection is
        not already in a transaction. Concurrent calls queue on the
        writer lock rather than racing on SELECT-then-INSERT/UPDATE
        patterns. Nested invocations (caller already in a tx)
        participate in that tx without starting their own BEGIN.

        Shared by ``resolve_conflict``, ``resolve_conflict_by_facts``,

        (including ``consolidate_fact``) all use one canonical

        Caller-contract caveat (per E2.a.7 ledger row): a DEFERRED
        outer transaction (Python sqlite3's default implicit tx) does
        NOT acquire the writer lock until its own first INSERT/UPDATE.
        Two threads each in their own DEFERRED outer tx can both pass
        the SELECT-no-match check before either writes — the race
        window reopens inside the outer scope. Race safety inside a
        caller-owned outer tx requires either (a) the outer tx is
        ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` or ``BEGIN EXCLUSIVE``, OR (b) the caller
        is the only writer (e.g., E2's single-threaded batch
        enrichment loop).
